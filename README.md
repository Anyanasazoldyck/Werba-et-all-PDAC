PDAC is notoriously difficult to treat, and it is also known for its very dynamic tumor microenvironment that acts as both a driver for this disease progression and a shelter against possible therapy. In thier paper, Werba et al (2023) look into how chemotherapy affects the PDAC tumor microenvironment. I am re-analyzing publicly availble data from Werba et al (2023).This paper uses 27 samples from PDAC tumors. In my re-analysis, I removed the liver samples early on because I wanted to focus on the effect of chemotherapy on the TME in the primary PDAC site. 

To focus on the effect of chemotherapy on the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the primary PDAC site, I analyzed 17 PDAC samples taken from the primary sites through resection (n=10) or Endoscopic Ultrasound–guided biopsy (EUS) (n=7), and I completely excluded the samples taken from the liver metastasis (n=10).
