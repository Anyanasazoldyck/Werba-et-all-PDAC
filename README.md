#About This Project
PDAC is notoriously difficult to treat, and it is also known for its very dynamic tumor microenvironment that acts as both a driver for this disease progression and a shelter against possible therapy. In thier paper, Werba et al (2023) look into how chemotherapy affects the PDAC tumor microenvironment. I am re-analyzing publicly availble data from Werba et al (2023).This paper uses 27 samples from PDAC tumors. In my re-analysis, I removed the liver samples early on because I wanted to focus on the effect of chemotherapy on the TME in the primary PDAC site.
